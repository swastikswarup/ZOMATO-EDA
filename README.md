Objective
The goal of this project is to: 1.Analyze cost for two, online order, and table booking options across different restaurant. 2.Understand customer vote and rating patterns. 3.Provide recommendations for restaurants and customers based on insights.

Dataset
The dataset contains 148 entries and 7 features, including: name: Name of the Restaurant listed online_order: online ordering option available or not book_table: Table booking option available or not rate: Rating of the restaurant votes: Votes of the restaurant approx_cost(for two people): Approx. cost for two listed_in(type): Listed Restaurant type (e.g.-Dining,Cafes,Buffet, others)

Steps and Workflow
1. Data Cleaning Fix data types: Converted rate to a float object.

2. EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis) Rating of Restaurant: highest and Lowest rated restaurant

1.Price Analysis: Maximum cost and minimun cost for two in the restaurants listed Online Ordering option: 90 restaurants does not have online order option available.

2.Table booking option: 140 restaurants does not have table booking option.

3.Types of Listed restaurants: Used histogram to get the count for each restaurant type.

4.Price distribution: Used histograms to show the distribution of prices. Majority of the listings were priced between rupees 100 - 600.

5.Review behavior: Used pair plots to show relationships between number of rating, votes, and cost for two for each restaurant type.

3. Data Visualization Pairplot: To see correlations among cost_for_two, votes, and number of ratings. Heatmap: Showing correlations among numerical features. Histograms and Boxplots: To detect outliers in price. Scatter plot: Displaying rating and cost for two distributions.

Key Findings and Insights
Rating : Highest is Onesta and Lowest rated restaurant is Nandhini Deluxe Online order: Most of the restaurants does not have online ordering option available Price: Most of the restaurants approx. cost for two lies between 200-600 Table booking : 140 restaurants does not have table booking options Types of Restaurants Listed: Majority are Dinning, few are cafes and very less number of buffet

Encourage user reviews and ratings for higher engagement. Track high-performing categories like Dine-out or Buffet for expansion.

Conclusion
This project offers valuable insights into the Zomato Restaurant data, helping both customers and owners make informed decisions. By using EDA techniques, we identified key trends and developed actionable recommendations. Future improvements can involve advanced analytics and predictive modeling to further enhance the findings.
